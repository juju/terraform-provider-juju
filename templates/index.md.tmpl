# Juju Provider

The provider can be used to interact with [Juju][0] - a model-driven Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) by Canonical.

Initially this provider allows you to:

* Manage models,
* Manage applications and deploy charms from CharmHub,
* Manage integrations.

In future the provider will be extended to support more of Juju's capabilities.

## Prerequisites

### Juju CLI configuration store

The provider has a dependency on Juju CLI configuration store.

In order to operate, the provider expects configuration to be found in one of the following locations:

* `$XDG_DATA_HOME/juju`
* `~/.local/share/juju`

The intention is to remove this dependency in future.
