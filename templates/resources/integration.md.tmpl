### Notes
When creating this resource the `offer_url` property will show `(known after apply)` if a `name` or
 `name` and `endpoint` are supplied as below:
```
  + resource "juju_integration" "this" {
      + id    = (known after apply)
      + model = "this"
      + via   = "10.0.0.0/24,10.0.1.0/24"

      + application {
          + endpoint  = (known after apply)
          + name      = "one"
          + offer_url = (known after apply)
        }
    }
```
This is due to an integration requiring a name/endpoint combination or an offer_url, but not both
bits of data together.

#### Cross-model relations

Version 0.23.0 of the provider introduced a change when integrating with an offer (i.e. when specifying the `offer_url`). 
The provider will create a remote application name with the format `<remote-app>-<local-app>-<interface>`. For example,
when relating a local application called `discourse` with an offer url of the form `admin/dbModel.postgresql`, using the `database` interface, the remote application will have the name `postgresql-discourse-database`.

In previous versions of the provider, the remote application would always have the same name as the application in the offer url, i.e. `postgresql` in the example above.

While change is backwards compatible, it uncovered a Juju bug that will cause an issue when relating to the same offer
multiple times, see https://github.com/juju/juju/issues/20818 for more details.
For this reason, the change is being reverted in v0.23.1 of the provider. 

While deployments made using v0.23.0 will continue to work, you may have noticed `saas` applications with the name `<remote-app>-<local-app>-<interface>`. After upgrading to v0.23.1, these apps will continue
to exist and work as expected but newly consumed offers will follow the previous naming convention.

See the diagrams below for a comparison of the changes.

{{ if .HasImport -}}
## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

{{codefile "shell" "examples/resources/juju_integration/import.sh"}}

Alternatively, it's possible to use the `import` block in your plan with an offer URL. For example:
```tf
import {
  to = juju_integration.this
  id = "${data.juju_model.development.uuid}:percona-cluster:server:wordpress:db"
}
```

### Cross-controller integration import

It's also possible to import an integration between models on different controllers. For example:

{{codefile "tf" "examples/resources/juju_integration/cross_controller_import.tf"}}

To verify that you'll get the result you want, check the output of terraform plan -- it should 
show resources being imported and none destroyed and recreated. For example:

```shell
Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # juju_integration.sink-source will be imported
    resource "juju_integration" "db" {
        id         = "...:ppercona-cluster:server:wordpress:db"
        model_uuid = "..."

        application {
            endpoint            = "db"
            offer_url           = "owner/db-model.db"
            offering_controller = "db-controller"
        }
        application {
            endpoint = "source"
            name     = "server"
        }
    }

Plan: 1 to import, 0 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
```

{{- end }}
