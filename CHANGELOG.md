## 0.4.2 (November 17, 2022)

NOTES:

* Added support for Juju 2.9.37
* Fix issue [96](https://github.com/juju/terraform-provider-juju/issues/96)
* Fix issue [95](https://github.com/juju/terraform-provider-juju/issues/95)

## 0.4.1 (August 25, 2022)

NOTES:

* The provider now receives the values for the `CharmConfig` while reading an already deployed application's status.

## 0.4.0 (August 19, 2022)

FEATURES:

* **Application expose** is now available.

NOTES:

* Now the provider considers the current status of `expose` and `config` for any application. This means, that when a plan is applied, this is compared with the current status returned by Juju and applied when required. For example, an exposed application can be manually unexposed using the Juju CLI. When applying the plan again, the provider will detect a mismatch and expose the application again.
* Following the previous note, the application configuration returned by Juju can contain more elements than those the plan is aware of. For this reason, the provider will only consider those parameteres already specified in the plan. This means that if any configuration parameter is manually set using the Juju CLI and this parameter is not set in the plan, no changes will be applied by the provider.
