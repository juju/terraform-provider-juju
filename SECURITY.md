# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

The easiest way to report a security issue is through
[GitHub](https://github.com/juju/terraform-provider-juju/security/advisories/new). See
[Privately reporting a security
vulnerability](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability)
for instructions.

The Juju Terraform provider GitHub admins will be notified of the issue and
will work with you to determine whether the issue qualifies as a security 
issue and, if so, in which component. We will then handle figuring out a 
fix, getting a CVE assigned and coordinating the release of the fix to the
various Linux distributions.

The [Ubuntu Security disclosure and embargo 
policy](https://ubuntu.com/security/disclosure-policy) contains more
information about what you can expect when you contact us, and what we
expect from you.
