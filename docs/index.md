# Juju Provider

The provider can be used to interact with [Juju][0] - a model-driven Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) by Canonical.

Initially this provider allows you to:

* Manage models,
* Manage applications and deploy charms from CharmHub,
* Manage integrations.

In future the provider will be extended to support more of Juju's capabilities.

## Prerequisites

### Juju CLI configuration store

The provider has a dependency on Juju CLI configuration store.

In order to operate, the provider expects configuration to be found in one of the following locations:

* `$XDG_DATA_HOME/juju`
* `~/.local/share/juju`

The intention is to remove this dependency in future.

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "juju" {
  controller_addresses = "10.225.205.241:17070,10.225.205.242:17070"

  username = "jujuuser"
  password = "password1"

  ca_certificate = file("~/ca-cert.pem")
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
