  model       = juju_model.development.name

## Schema

### Required

- `model` (String) The Juju model in which to add a new machine.
- `series` (String) The operating system series to install on the new machine(s).

### Optional

- `constraints` (String) Machine constraints that overwrite those available from 'juju get-model-constraints' and provider's defaults.
- `disks` (String) Storage constraints for disks to attach to the machine(s).
- `name` (String) A name for the machine resource in Terraform.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `machine_id` (String) The id of the machine Juju creates.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# Machines can be imported using the format: `model_name:machine_id:machine_name`.
# The value of machine_id is the Juju Machine ID. machine_name is an optional 
# name you can define in Terraform for the machine. It is not used in Juju.
# Here is an example to import a machine from the development model with 
# machine ID 1 and a name "machine_one":
$ terraform import juju_machine.machine_one `development:1:machine_one`
```
