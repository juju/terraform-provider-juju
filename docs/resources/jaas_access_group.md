## Schema

### Required

- `group_id` (String) The ID of the group for access management. If this is changed the resource will be deleted and a new resource will be created.

### Optional

- `groups` (Set of String) List of groups to grant access. A valid group ID is the group's UUID.
- `service_accounts` (Set of String) List of service accounts to grant access. A valid service account is the service account's name.
- `users` (Set of String) List of users to grant access. A valid user is the user's name or email.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# JAAS group access can be imported using the group UUID and access level
$ terraform import juju_jaas_access_group.development UUID:member
```
