## Schema

- `role_id` (String) The UUID of the role for access management. If this is changed the resource will be deleted and a new resource will be created.

### Optional

- `groups` (Set of String) List of groups to grant access. A valid group ID is the group's UUID.
- `service_accounts` (Set of String) List of service accounts to grant access. A valid service account is the service account's name.
- `users` (Set of String) List of users to grant access. A valid user is the user's name or email.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# JAAS role access can be imported using the role UUID and access level
$ terraform import juju_jaas_access_role.development UUID:assignee
```
