# juju_integration (Resource)

A resource that represents a Juju Integration.

## Example Usage
```terraform
resource "juju_integration" "this" {
  model = juju_model.development.name
  via   = "10.0.0.0/24,10.0.1.0/24"

  application {
    name     = juju_application.wordpress.name
    endpoint = "db"
  }

  application {
    name     = juju_application.percona-cluster.name
    endpoint = "server"
  }
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `application` (Block Set, Min: 2, Max: 2) The two applications to integrate. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--application))
- `model` (String) The name of the model to operate in.

### Optional

- `via` (String) A comma separated list of CIDRs for outbound traffic.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedblock--application"></a>
### Nested Schema for `application`

Optional:

- `endpoint` (String) The endpoint name.
- `name` (String) The name of the application.
- `offer_url` (String) The URL of a remote application.


### Notes
When creating this resource the `offer_url` property will show `(known after apply)` as below:
```
  + resource "juju_integration" "this" {
      + id    = (known after apply)
      + model = "this"
      + via   = "10.0.0.0/24,10.0.1.0/24"

      + application {
          + endpoint  = (known after apply)
          + name      = "one"
          + offer_url = (known after apply)
        }
    }
```
This is due to a bug in the sdk this provider uses - this property will never be computed and can only be provided by the user.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# Integrations can be imported by using the format: model_name:provider_app_name:endpoint:requirer_app_name:endpoint, for example:
$ terraform import juju_integration.wordpress_db development:percona-cluster:server:wordpress:db
```
