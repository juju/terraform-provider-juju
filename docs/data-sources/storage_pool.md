  Use the storage pool data source to retrieve information about an existing Juju storage pool. This is useful when you need to reference storage pool attributes such as the pool attributes in other resources. Storage pools can be looked up by their name with a model UUID or a model owner and model name e.g. admin/myModel. The owner is the user that created the model and can be found with the 'juju show-model' command.

# juju_storage_pool (Data Source)

Use the storage pool data source to retrieve information about an existing Juju storage pool. This is useful when you need to reference storage pool attributes such as the pool attributes in other resources. Storage pools can be looked up by their name with a model UUID or a model owner and model name e.g. admin/myModel. The owner is the user that created the model and can be found with the 'juju show-model' command.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "juju_model" "my_model" {
  name = "default"
}

data "juju_storage_pool" "my_storage_pool_data_source" {
  name       = "my_storage_pool"
  model_uuid = data.juju_model.my_model.uuid
  # Or:
  model_name  = data.juju_model.my_model.name
  model_owner = data.juju_model.my_model.owner
}
```
