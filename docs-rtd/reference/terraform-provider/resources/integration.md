# juju_integration (Resource)

A resource that represents a Juju Integration.

## Example Usage
```terraform
resource "juju_integration" "this" {
  model_uuid = juju_model.development.uuid
  via        = "10.0.0.0/24,10.0.1.0/24"

  application {
    name     = juju_application.wordpress.name
    endpoint = "db"
  }

  application {
    name     = juju_application.percona-cluster.name
    endpoint = "server"
  }

  # Add any RequiresReplace schema attributes of
  # an application in this integration to ensure
  # it is recreated if one of the applications
  # is Destroyed and Recreated by terraform. E.G.:
  lifecycle {
    replace_triggered_by = [
      juju_application.wordpress.name,
      juju_application.wordpress.model,
      juju_application.wordpress.constraints,
      juju_application.wordpress.placement,
      juju_application.wordpress.charm.name,
      juju_application.percona-cluster.name,
      juju_application.percona-cluster.model,
      juju_application.percona-cluster.constraints,
      juju_application.percona-cluster.placement,
      juju_application.percona-cluster.charm.name,
    ]
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `model_uuid` (String) The UUID of the model to operate in.

### Optional

- `application` (Block Set) The two applications to integrate. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--application))
- `via` (String) A comma separated list of CIDRs for outbound traffic.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedblock--application"></a>
### Nested Schema for `application`

Optional:

- `endpoint` (String) The endpoint name. This attribute may not be used at the same time as the offer_url.
- `external_controller` (String) The name of the external controller where the remote application is hosted. This is required when using offer_url to consume an offer from a different controller.
- `name` (String) The name of the application. This attribute may not be used at the same time as the offer_url.
- `offer_url` (String) The URL of a remote application. This attribute may not be used at the same time as name and endpoint.


### Notes
When creating this resource the `offer_url` property will show `(known after apply)` if a `name` or
 `name` and `endpoint` are supplied as below:
```
  + resource "juju_integration" "this" {
      + id    = (known after apply)
      + model = "this"
      + via   = "10.0.0.0/24,10.0.1.0/24"

      + application {
          + endpoint  = (known after apply)
          + name      = "one"
          + offer_url = (known after apply)
        }
    }
```
This is due to an integration requiring a name/endpoint combination or an offer_url, but not both
bits of data together.

#### Cross-model relations

Version 0.23.0 of the provider introduced a change when integrating with an offer (i.e. when specifying the `offer_url`). 
The provider will create a remote application name with the format `<remote-app>-<local-app>-<interface>`. For example,
when relating a local application called `discourse` with an offer url of the form `admin/dbModel.postgresql`, using the `database` interface, the remote application will have the name `postgresql-discourse-database`.

In previous versions of the provider, the remote application would always have the same name as the application in the offer url, i.e. `postgresql` in the example above.

While change is backwards compatible, it uncovered a Juju bug that will cause an issue when relating to the same offer
multiple times, see https://github.com/juju/juju/issues/20818 for more details.
For this reason, the change is being reverted in v0.23.1 of the provider. 

While deployments made using v0.23.0 will continue to work, you may have noticed `saas` applications with the name `<remote-app>-<local-app>-<interface>`. After upgrading to v0.23.1, these apps will continue
to exist and work as expected but newly consumed offers will follow the previous naming convention.

See the diagrams below for a comparison of the changes.

Before v0.23.0:

```

v0.23.0:

    E--> F[App C]
```

v0.23.1:
Same as before v0.23.0.


## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# Integrations can be imported by using the format: model_uuid:provider_app_name:endpoint:requirer_app_name:endpoint.
# For integrations with an offer url, replace the requirer_app_name with the remote application name. The remote app
# name can be found by running `juju status` and looking for the SAAS heading.
# For example:
$ terraform import juju_integration.wordpress_db 4b6bd192-13bb-489d-b7a7-06f6efc2928d:percona-cluster:server:wordpress:db
```
