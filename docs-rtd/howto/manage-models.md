## Reference an externally managed model

To reference a model that you've created outside of the current Terraform plan, in your Terraform plan add a data source of the `juju_model` type, specifying the name of the model. For example:

```terraform
data "juju_model" "mymodel" {
  name = "development"
}
```

> See more: [`juju_model` (data source)](../reference/terraform-provider/data-sources/model)

## Add a model

To add a model to the controller specified in the `juju` provider definition, in your Terraform plan create a resource of the `juju_model` type, specifying, at the very least, a name. For example:

```terraform
resource "juju_model" "testmodel" {
  name = "machinetest"
}

```

In the case of a multi-cloud controller, you can specify which cloud you want the model to be associated with by defining a `cloud` block. To specify a model configuration, include a `config` block.

## Configure a model

>
> See related: {external+juju:ref}`Juju | Configure a controller <configure-a-controller>`

With the Terraform Provider for Juju you can only set configuration values, only for a specific model, and only a workload model; for anything else, please use the `juju`  CLI.

To configure a specific workload model, in your Terraform plan, in the model's resource definition, specify a `config` block, listing all the key=value pairs you want to set. For example:

```terraform
resource "juju_model" "this" {
  name = "development"

  cloud {
    name   = "aws"
    region = "eu-west-1"
  }

  config = {
    logging-config              = "<root>=INFO"
    development                 = true
    no-proxy                    = "jujucharms.com"
    update-status-hook-interval = "5m"
  }
}
```

## Manage constraints for a model
> See also: {external+juju:ref}`Juju | Constraint <constraint>`

With the Terraform Provider for Juju you can only set constraints -- to view them, please use the `juju` CLI.

To set constraints for a model, in your Terraform, in the model's resource definition, specify the `constraints` attribute (value is a quotes-enclosed space-separated list of key=value pairs). For example:

```terraform
resource "juju_model" "this" {
  name = "development"

  cloud {
    name   = "aws"
    region = "eu-west-1"
  }

  constraints = "cores=4 mem=16G"
}
```

## Manage annotations for a model
To set annotations for a model, in your Terraform, in the model's resource definition, specify an `annotations` block, listing all the key=value pairs you want to set. For example:

```terraform
resource "juju_model" "testmodel" {
  name = "model"

  annotations = {
	  test = "test"
  }
}
```

> See more: [`juju_model` (resource)](../reference/terraform-provider/resources/model)

## Manage access to a model

Your model access management options depend on whether the controller you are applying the Terraform plan to is a regular Juju controller or rather a Juju controller added to JIMM -- for the former you can grant access only to a user, but for the latter you can grant access to a user, a service account, a role, or a group.


### For a regular Juju controller
To grant one or more users access to a model, in your Terraform plan add a `juju_access_model` resource. You must specify the model, the Juju access level, and the user(s) to which you want to grant access. For example:

```terraform
resource "juju_access_model" "this" {
  model  = juju_model.dev.name
  access = "write"
  users  = [juju_user.dev.name, juju_user.qa.name]
}
```

> See more: [`juju_access_model`](../reference/terraform-provider/resources/access_model), [Juju | Model access levels](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/juju/3.6/reference/user/#valid-access-levels-for-models)


### For a Juju controller added to JIMM
To grant one or more users, service accounts, roles, and/or groups access to a model, in your Terraform plan add a resource type `juju_jaas_access_model`. You must specify the model UUID, the JAAS model access level, and the desired list of users, service accounts, roles, and/or groups. For example:

```terraform
resource "juju_jaas_access_model" "development" {
  model_uuid       = juju_model.development.uuid
  access           = "administrator"
  users            = ["foo@domain.com"]
  service_accounts = ["Client-ID-1", "Client-ID-2"]
  roles            = [juju_jaas_role.development.uuid]
  groups           = [juju_jaas_group.development.uuid]
}

```

(migrate-a-model)=
## Migrate a model

This section highlights what changes, if any, are needed to your Terraform plan after migrating a model(s) between Juju controllers and/or JAAS. The Juju provider itself does not currently support migrating a model to a new controller, use the Juju CLI instead.

### Migrating to another Juju controller

After a model is migrated to a new Juju controller, no changes are needed. Simply update your plan to connect to the new controller.

The only exception to this scenario is when cross-model relations are involved. If both models involved in a cross-model relation are moved, no changes are necessary. If only one model involved in the relation is moved, see below.

(manage-migration-cross-controller-relations)=
### Cross-controller relations

If the providing model is moved, your applications will continue to work but the Juju provider has limitations on creating {ref}`cross-controller relations <add-a-cross-model-relation>`.

This means that, if you modify your plan in a way that causes recreation of the relation, the creation operation will fail.

### Migrating to JAAS

Migrating models to a JAAS environment requires some updates to your Terraform plan when cross-model relations are involved, even if both models in the relation are migrated.

When a model is migrated to JAAS, the model's name and offer URLs will change. The JAAS documention on [model management](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/jaas/latest/howto/manage-models/) provides more detail.

Our recommended way of resolving your Terraform state for this scenario is described below.

While it is recommended to migrate **all** models involved in a relation to JAAS, it is not a requirement, and migration can be done slowly over the course of days and weeks. See the section on {ref}`cross-controller relations <add-a-cross-model-relation>` for the provider's limitations on cross-controller relations.

```{admonition} Migration order
There is no recommended order to migrate your models. Regardless of the order you decide to migrate your models, i.e. providing model first or consuming model first, cross-model application offers are expected to continue working.
```

#### Handling the provider model

When the model providing an application offer is migrated to JAAS, its offer URL changes. Running your Terraform plan against the new controller will attempt to recreate the offer, breaking any applications with existing relations.

To resolve this we suggest removing the resource from Terraform's state and re-importing it using the following commands:

```text
terraform state rm juju_offer.<resource-name>
terraform import juju_offer.<resource-name> <new-offer-url>
```

The new offer URL can be obtained by running `juju show-offer <offer-name>` in the model hosting the offer.

#### Handling the consuming model

When the model consuming an application is migrated to JAAS, there may be changes required depending on how your plan is designed.

The following snippet will cause an error after migration:

```terraform
data "juju_offer" "source-offer" {
  url = "admin/source-model.dummy-source"
}

resource "juju_integration" "sink_source_integration" {
  model = juju_model.this.name

  application {
    offer_url = juju_offer.source-offer.url
  }

  application {
    name     = juju_application.sink.name
    endpoint = "source"
  }

}
```

The `juju_offer` data source will return an error because this offer no longer exists at the same URL. However, the relation itself will continue to work because this URL is only used once, during the creation of the relation.

To resolve this error we suggest one of 2 options:

1. Recreate the relation using the new URL.
2. Change the plan to resemble the example below.

The simplest solution is to recreate the relation. Replace the URL in the data source with the new offer URL and allow Terraform to recreate the relation. Note that issue https://github.com/juju/juju/issues/20630 highlights a bug that causes issues for integrations on migrated models.

If the application cannot tolerate any downtime, we suggest modifying the plan to hardcode the offer URL into the integration resource and recreate the relation during a maintenance window.

Example:

```terraform
resource "juju_integration" "sink_source_integration" {
  model = juju_model.this.name

  application {
    offer_url = "admin/source-model.dummy-source"
  }

  application {
    name     = juju_application.sink.name
    endpoint = "source"
  }

}
```

## Upgrade a model
> See also: {external+juju:ref}`Juju | Upgrading things <upgrading-things>`

To migrate a model to another controller, use the `juju` CLI to perform the migration, then, in your Terraform plan, reconfigure the `juju` provider to point to the destination controller (we recommend the method where you configure the provider using static credentials). You can verify your configuration changes by running `terraform plan` and noticing no change: Terraform merely compares the plan to what it finds in your deployment -- if model migration with `juju` has been successful, it should detect no change.
