## Control the number of units

To control the number of units of an application, in its resource definition specify a `units` attribute. For example, below we set it to 3.


```terraform
resource "juju_application" "this" {
  model = juju_model.development.name

  charm {
    name = "hello-kubecon"
  }

  units = 3
}
```
