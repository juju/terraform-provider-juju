The Terraform Provider for Juju is a [Terraform Provider](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/providers) that extends [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform) with [Juju](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/juju) and [JAAS](https://jaas.ai/) functionality.

When you're putting together your Terraform plan, if you specify `juju` as the provider, you can connect to a pre-existing Juju controller or JIMM controller and then go ahead and use it to do Juju things -- easy deploy, configure, integrate, scale, etc., infrastructure and applications on any Juju-supported cloud (Kubernetes or otherwise) using charms.

The Terraform Provider for Juju combines the power of Terraform -- comprehensive infrastructure management, declaratively -- with the power of Juju -- easy systems management, from Day 0 to Day n.

Like all of Juju, the Terraform Provider for Juju is for SREs, or anyone looking to take control of cloud.
